Before I watched these videos, I was exploring the bubble code by myself. Here are some thing I found.

By changing the numbers in line 10, we can change the size of those bubbles. Smaller numbers, tinier bubbles.

By changing the numbers in line 32 and 33, we can change how vigorous those bubbles move. Bigger number, more vigorous motions.

By changing the numbers in line 28, we can change the color of those bubbles. Here are some conclusions I got from test. (255, 255, 200, 200) shows yellow. (255, 200, 255, 200) shows purple. (200, 255, 200, 200) shows green. (200, 200, 255, 200) shows blue.

By changing the number in line 6, we can change the amount of those bubbles. Bigger number, more bubbles.

By changing the number in line 17, we can change the color of the background.
